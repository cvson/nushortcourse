This is to provide some tutorials for using GLoBES framework https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/personalhomes/globes/index.html
## T2K pre-defined experiment from https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/personalhomes/globes/glb/T2K.html but it is out of date and it is not simple to explain for students in a short introduction. 
## We then decide to use the one we used in the https://inspirehep.net/literature/1870125
## First modify the Makefile
   - globes prefix must be changed to your repository
   - For MacOS, you need to add `local_CFLAGS += -D_REENTRANT -stdlib=libc++ -I\path-to-your-root-header\`
## For obtain the oscillation probabilities from GLoBES
   - source code in `glbProb.c`
   - compile `make glbProb`
   - run `./glbProb`, should produce `glbProb_4vson.root` output
   - you can look at the graphs of probability inside or use 
   - `plot_dcpth23_prob.C` to plot the probability of muon neutrino to electron neutrinos in 2D correlation between dcp and theta_23 mixing angle and also can obtain the iso-probability

## For obtain the event rate with and without smearing in the post-efficiency
   - source code in `eventrateall.c`
   - compile `make eventrateall`
   - run `./eventrateall`
   - modify to run with t2k2_final_wsmear.glb and t2k2_final_nosmear.glb to produce eventrate_all_t2k2_final_wsmear.root and eventrate_all_t2k2_final_nosmear.root
   - To make event rate histogram, run checkWithSmearing_all_final.C and checkNoSmearing_all_final.C

## For sensitivity 
  - source code in `test_cp_null.c`
  - compile `make test_cp_null`
  - run `./test_cp_null`
  - modify to run with t2k2_final_wsmear.glb and t2k2_final_nosmear.glb to produce t2k2_final_wsmear_sensi_cp.root and t2k2_final_nosmear_sensi_cp.root
  - plot and compare with T2K using `plot_dcp_t2k2.C`

## For generate fake data and make a fit on this fake data
  - use `createFakeData_forFit.C` to make a fake data, the data is copied over to `t2k2_final_wsmear_wdata.glb`
  - use program in `test_cp_null_fakedata.c`
  - compile `make test_cp_null_fakedata`
