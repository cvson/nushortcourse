This is to provide some tutorials for using GLoBES framework https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/personalhomes/globes/index.html
## You must download T2K pre-defined experiment from https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/personalhomes/globes/glb/T2K.html and extract all the files in the same folder
## First modify the Makefile
   - globes prefix must be changed to your repository
   - For MacOS, you need to add `local_CFLAGS += -D_REENTRANT -stdlib=libc++ -I\path-to-your-root-header\`
## For obtain the oscillation probabilities from GLoBES
   - source code glbProb.c
   - compile `make glbProb`
   - run `./glbProb`, should produce `glbProb_4vson.root` output
   - you can look at the graphs of probability inside or use 
   - `plot_dcpth23_prob.C` to plot the probability of muon neutrino to electron neutrinos in 2D correlation between dcp and theta_23 mixing angle and also can obtain the iso-probability
