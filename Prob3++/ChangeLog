Library Version 2.1  (2012.12.25)

 + Allow differentiation between "one mass scale" mode 
   and standard two mass scale schemes. This only 
   affects the way in which the mass hierarchy is 
   input in the computation

Library Version 2.0  (2012.11.08)

 + User is no longer responsible for changing the sign 
   of delta_cp for antineutrino propagation 
 + Add a simple example program to compute mu2e oscillation 
   probabilities using an analytic expression.
 + Proton to Neutron ratio used to defined conversion from
   matter to electron density is now configurable 


Library Version 1.0  (versions prior to 2012.11.08)

 + Original library version 
   
   * To compute oscillation probabilities assuming an inverted hierarchy
     use a negative number for the value of delta-m^2

   * To compute oscillation probabilities for antineutrinos
     - Change the sign of the input neutrino flavor ( see below )
     - Change the sign of Delta_cp
